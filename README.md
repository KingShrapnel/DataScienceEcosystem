This is a repository i created to showcase my Jupyter Notebook on the Data Science ecosystem. 
The contents of this notebook outline the tools essential for working in Data Science. 
Please note that this is not an expansive list, but is instead meant as an introductory pointer of sorts to the most commonly used tools. 

Thank you, 
Your author, Kudzai Chisango.
